#### **Items**


On this screen, the user must select the items that will be added to the promotion (or batch of promotions). Here we have a Filtering Section similar with the one at Division and Company.


First step is to select the **View** that you want to use for the filters. By default, **Global View** will be selected but you have the option to switch to **Local View**.


> Local View is available only when the promotion is created for one company.

Next, the items can be filtered by manufacturer, brand, groups, sub-groups and lines.


The is also the option to **Bulk Add Items** by Item ID or Search for them in the search field.

> The Add button reflects the number of Global Items available in your selection. Once you click on it, all local items matching to the global items in your selection will be added.

After you add items, these will be added into grids in the lower section of the window.
Here you can have more tables, one corresponding to each currency of the Companies previously selected. Above each table, you can see the Currency and the matching Company codes. You also have a filter box, where you can search for a certain Item by any of the values available in the grid.

> When you add **Not Assorted** items in the grids, these will be marked by red highlight and an information icon in front of Global Item column. For each item, you can see the below details:
- Date of last gathered price – For all items (assorted and not assorted) you will see the date of last gathered price while rolling your mouse over the DF Price or DP Price;
- Shops in which the item is not assorted – by rolling your mouse over the information icon you will see a list of shops where that item is not present in the assortment. You can expand the information by clicking on the information icon and a pop-up window will be opened.


#### **Promotion Summary**


On this screen you will see details about Promotion Status, ID, Company, Shops, Curremcy, Description and Item Details.


From Promotion Summary you have the below options:

- View Created Promotions – by clicking on each Prompotion ID to open it in View Mode.
- Export Promotion to excel – you can export one Promotion at once in excel format and you will receive the file downloaded from your browser.
- Export unassorted items – you will receive the details for unassorted items in the file downloaded from your browser.
- Export unmatched items – you will receive the details for unmatched items in the file downloaded from your browser.


> At this stage, any new promotion will not become Active until it has a Promotion Terms associated.


You can add terms by clicking on the Open Terms button or you can come back later to add Terms either by editing the promotions and reaching  the last step or by accessing the Terms Creation page straight from View Promotion Mode.
